# Simple-PHP-Local-Host-Bot
This is a simple local host for PHP written in Python.
To use it, download the file `bot.py` and place it in the folder that contains your PHP file.
Navigate to your/folder/path in the terminal and then run `python3 bot.py`. It will generate a link for you to view your PHP file in your web browser.
Press Enter to stop the server and 'C' to clear the terminal.

#Tip: Make sure you have PHP installed on your computer. :)
